# 🏥 Healthcare Patient Insights (Excel)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing **healthcare patient data** to derive insights related to **patient demographics, medical conditions, treatment patterns, and healthcare costs**.

The objective of the analysis is to support **data-driven decision-making** by identifying key trends, high-impact factors, and cost drivers using Excel-based exploratory and diagnostic analysis.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Understand the **distribution of patients** across demographic groups  
- Identify **high-prevalence medical conditions**
- Analyze **treatment and billing patterns**
- Detect key factors contributing to **healthcare cost variation**
- Perform structured **EDA** to support healthcare insights

---

## 🗂 Dataset Information
- Source: Healthcare patient case study dataset  
- Records: ~5,200 patient records  
- Attributes: 18 columns including:
  - Age
  - Gender
  - Diagnosis
  - Treatment type
  - Hospital stay details
  - Billing and cost-related fields  

---

## 🛠 Tools & Techniques Used
- **Microsoft Excel**
  - Power Query for data cleaning
  - Pivot Tables for aggregation
  - Statistical summaries
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Visual analysis using charts and graphs

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Removed duplicates and inconsistencies
- Standardized categorical values
- Handled missing and invalid records
- Created a clean **working dataset** for analysis
- Validated hygiene checks before EDA

---

## 🔎 Analysis Performed
- Demographic analysis (age, gender distribution)
- Medical condition frequency analysis
- Treatment-level cost comparison
- Billing variance analysis to identify **major cost drivers**
- Sample size and distribution checks
- Multi-level EDA across patients, treatments, and costs

---

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The following EDA visuals were created to support insights:

- Patient distribution analysis  
- Cost vs treatment comparisons  
- Diagnosis frequency analysis  
- Sample size distribution validation  

(EDA visuals included in the repository as images)

---

## 📈 Key Insights
- A limited set of medical conditions contributes to a **significant portion of total healthcare cost**
- Certain age groups show **higher treatment frequency and cost impact**
- Treatment type and duration explain **~27% of billing variance**
- Patient segmentation helps identify **high-risk and high-cost groups**

---

## ✅ Outcome
This project demonstrates my ability to:
- Work with real-world healthcare datasets
- Perform structured data cleaning and EDA
- Analyze healthcare costs and patient patterns
- Translate raw healthcare data into actionable insights using Excel
